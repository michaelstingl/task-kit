# Changelog

Notable changes to the kit convention (`kit.schema.json`) and tooling (`board.ts`, `new-kit.ts`).
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versioning follows SemVer (see the
README "Versioning" section). The canonical version number lives only in `kit.schema.json`
(`version`); this file is the only place release notes live.

## 0.9.1

### Changed
- **`board.ts` no longer warns on `kit_version` skew.** The field records the `MAJOR.MINOR` a kit was built under so it stays *readable* across additive schema bumps — that is its documented purpose, not drift. After the 0.9.0 MINOR bump the warning fired on **every** kit still stamped `0.8`, and a warning that flags everything trains readers to ignore the board's real findings (duplicate ids, off-enum status). Actual conformance is now `lint.ts`'s job; the board returns to a pure reporter. The `kit_version` field and its stamping by `new-kit.ts` are unchanged — nothing reads it behaviorally anymore.

## 0.9.0

### Added
- **`lint.ts` — a write-time marker validator**, and the closed sets it enforces, now declared in `kit.schema.json` under a new top-level `marker` key (`kinds`, `countedKinds`, `status.terminal`, `status.open`) as the single source. `bun lint.ts` walks every kit and **exits non-zero** on: an unknown marker **kind** (only `TODO/FIXME/DECISION/QUESTION/DEBT/NOTE` — invented `FINDING/TRIGGER/DANGER` are rejected, fold them into `NOTE`), an unknown **status** (with a suggested canonical, e.g. `dead`→`wontfix`, `resolved`→`done`), a **`DEBT` without `trigger=`**, and a **duplicate id** on two open markers in one kit. It is the "reject at write" that returns `board.ts` to a pure reporter — sprawl and collisions cannot accumulate for the board to warn about later. Wire it into a pre-commit hook / CI.
- **`board.ts` now hides the full terminal-status set** (read from `marker.status.terminal`): `done`, `wontfix`, plus `answered` (a resolved QUESTION), `superseded`/`decided` (a settled DECISION) — previously only `done`/`wontfix`, so a `superseded` decision leaked onto the board as open. Single source shared with `lint.ts`.
- **MINOR** (additive): old kits stay valid; an older `board.ts` still works. Existing kits that used invented statuses/kinds will now be flagged by `lint.ts` — that surfacing is the point (migrate them).

## 0.8.0

### Added
- **`repos` is now in the schema.** It never was — 37 kits wrote it, `watch.ts` parsed it as a hard contract, and `additionalProperties: true` let it through in silence. An unvalidated contract drifts: the one field the reconcile depends on was the one field nothing checked.
- **`repos[].refs`** — issues *and* PRs together, unlimited, in one notation: `owner/repo#n`, or bare `#n` resolved against that entry's own `repo`. Nothing declares which kind a number is; the tooling asks GitHub (`.pull_request != null`) and reads state from there. It is the same notation `watch.ts` already scans for in prose, so frontmatter and text finally speak one dialect.
- **`board.ts` validates `repos`** — repo shape, ref format, and a warning on the deprecated scalars.

### Changed
- **One parser, two consumers.** `board.ts` now imports `parseRepos` from `watch.ts`. Its own frontmatter reader deliberately skips nested YAML, so it could never see `repos` at all — a check written against it there would have been a check that *cannot fire*. The board and the reconcile can no longer disagree about what a kit declares, which they silently did.
- `ownPrRefs` → **`ownRefs`**: it returns issues too now, so the old name lied. An entry with a branch contributes *all* its refs. This makes `isStale` more conservative on purpose — an open issue is open work, and a check that stays quiet while work is open is the kind that survives.

### Deprecated
- **`repos[].pr` and `repos[].issue`.** Still parsed (nothing disappears on upgrade) and only warned about, never rejected — making it fatal would light up every existing kit in one commit, and a board nobody can read is a board nobody reads.
- `issue:` deserves its epitaph: **written by 30 kits, read by nothing.** A bare number has no `#`, so the prose scanner never saw it; the frontmatter parser never looked for it. It fell between two stools for its whole life.

### Migration
- `issue: 12` + `pr: 14` → `refs: [#12, #14]`; bare `#n` resolves to that entry's `repo`.
- Bump each kit's `kit_version` to `0.8`. The board warns until you do — it compares MAJOR.MINOR only.
- **The rule that ships with the shape:** `repos` carries **in-flight work, not history**. Drop an entry once its work lands; the changelog and the PRs keep the record. Carrying merged entries forever makes every kit look terminal and the reconcile fires falsely.

## 0.7.0

### Added
- **New marker kind `DEBT`** — a knowingly accepted shortcut, a lightweight [Technical Debt Record](https://www.workingsoftware.dev/technical-debt-records/), distinct from `DECISION` by one **required** attr `trigger=` (the repay condition). The trigger is what keeps accepted debt from rotting — the documented failure mode of a plain `TODO` nobody revisits. `board.ts` aggregates `DEBT` in the OPEN column under the flag **`$`** (it can't reuse `DECISION`'s `D`), and **loudly flags any `DEBT` marker missing `trigger=`** (both a per-marker `⚠ needs trigger=` in the listing and a summary count). README documents the kind and its **lifecycle**: a `DEBT` marker is the working form while a problem lives in a kit; on graduation it is promoted into the project repo's own convention (e.g. a `docs/debt/` record), carrying the same fields. **MINOR** (additive): old kits stay valid, an older `board.ts` still works (it simply ignores `DEBT` markers).

## 0.6.4

### Added
- README: **"Sharing a live kit via a synced folder"** — documents the cross-machine/small-team pattern of sharing the whole kit folder through a synced folder (Dropbox, Nextcloud, OpenCloud, iCloud Drive, …). Because many sync clients do not follow symlinks (and some sync only one fixed folder per space), the working pattern inverts the usual layout: real bytes live **inside** the synced folder, a symlink in `kits/<slug>` points **in**. Includes the caveat to share only the text dossier, never a git worktree or build output. Convention/schema unchanged (doc-only).

## 0.6.3

### Changed
- `board.ts` now lists open markers (grouped by kit, priority-sorted) **by default**; pass `--brief` (or `--no-todos`) for the table-only view. The per-kit markers are the actionable detail, so the default view surfaces them — especially useful as a resume/handoff entry point after a context reset. `--todos` still works (now a no-op) for backward compatibility. Convention/schema unchanged: the `kit_version` compatibility check reads MAJOR.MINOR only, so all `0.6` kits stay valid.

## 0.6.2

### Added
- `watch.ts` now surfaces the **review decision** for open PR refs: `✓approved`, `⚠changes-requested`, or `review-required`. A change request also raises a `⚠` line flag, and the summary counts approvals and change requests. A review decision does not flip a PR's open/closed state, so the existing state/moved flags missed approvals and (more importantly) change requests; this closes that gap. Costs one extra `gh pr view` call per open PR ref. Convention/schema unchanged.

## 0.6.1

### Changed
- Renamed the project **`collaboration-kit` → `task-kit`** — clearer ("collaboration" over-claimed; it is a durable, personal-by-default folder per piece of work). Updated the repo, the schema `$id`, the tooling self-references, and the README tagline. Old GitHub URLs redirect. The convention itself is unchanged.

## 0.6.0

### Added
- `watch.ts` — checks the GitHub issues/PRs each kit references (from `links:`, markers, prose) via `gh`, flagging merged/closed (●) and anything that moved since the kit was last updated (▲). Read-only; requires an authenticated `gh`.
- Unit test for `watch.ts` ref extraction.

## 0.5.0

### Added
- Test suite (`bun test`): integration tests for `board.ts` and `new-kit.ts` — frontmatter parsing (trailing comments, block YAML), marker aggregation, slug ≠ folder, terminal-status hiding, lean vs contribution creation.
- `board.ts` warns when a kit's `kit_version` differs from the schema's `MAJOR.MINOR` (flags kits built under an older convention).

## 0.4.0

Close the loop: the full kit lifecycle and consumer onboarding are now covered.

### Added
- README "Adopt in a project" — how a project/teammate consumes the toolkit (clone + symlink `_work/collaboration-kit`, create `_work/kits` + `_work/kit-archive`, run tools from the project root, bun prerequisite).
- README "Releasing" — the release steps (bump schema, CHANGELOG, tag).
- Lifecycle: `board.ts` hides terminal-status kits (`merged`/`done`/`closed`) by default; `--all` shows them. Retiring a kit = move it to a sibling `kit-archive/`.

### Changed
- `template-contribution/SCOPE.md` status comment aligned with the schema enum.

## 0.3.0

### Changed
- The default `template/` is now lean and domain-agnostic (`Scope · Notes · Decision · Outcome · Next steps · Changelog`) — no code-fix sections, so a generic kit (setup, research, ops, design) carries no PR/repro noise.

### Added
- `template-contribution/` — the PR-yielding variant: adds `repos:`, the `Symptom`/`Reproduce`/`Gate`/`Merge order` sections, and the `issue.md` / `pr-body.md` stubs.
- `new-kit.ts --contribution` selects the contribution variant (default is lean).

## 0.2.1

### Added
- `AGENTS.md` — agent entry point that points to `README.md` (the single source), so the convention is self-discoverable when the repo is symlinked into a project.

### Changed
- Template `SCOPE.md` carries a concrete pointer to the conventions (local symlink path + canonical URL + `kit_version`) instead of a vague "see the repo README", so even a handed-off `SCOPE.md` resolves the convention.

## 0.2.0

The kit convention gains a machine-readable contract and tooling.

### Added
- `kit.schema.json` — generic kit frontmatter contract (required: `kit, title, status, created, updated`; optional: `kit_version, area, links`; `additionalProperties` allowed). `status` is an `enum` and the single source for the board's sort order.
- `board.ts` — read-only status board over `kits/*/SCOPE.md`; aggregates structured `TODO`/`DECISION`/`QUESTION`/`FIXME` markers (open unless `status=done`/`wontfix`); warns on drift (status off-enum, `kit` slug ≠ folder, malformed dates); reports the convention version.
- `new-kit.ts` — scaffold a kit from the template with the frontmatter stamped from the schema (including `kit_version`).
- Template (`template/SCOPE.md`): a structured TODO-marker example, `## Next steps`, and `## Changelog` sections.
- README: "The board" and "Versioning" (SemVer policy) sections.

### Notes
- SemVer policy: `kit.schema.json` is the contract; its compatibility sets the bump. The version lives only in the schema (`board.ts` reads it, the README never restates it) and release notes live only here, so a release touches just two files.

## 0.1.0

### Added
- Initial kit convention: a durable per-problem scratch folder with a `SCOPE.md` lead file (frontmatter + dossier sections) and a `template/` (`SCOPE.md`, `issue.md`, `pr-body.md`).
